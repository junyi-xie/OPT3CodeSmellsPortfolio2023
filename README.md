A project inspired by [Pokemon Showdown][1], which features a **variety** of [Digimon (デジモン)][2] from the popular franchise created in 1997 by [Akiyoshi Hongo][3].

# Digimon Battle Simulator

A JavaFX application made for Digimon fans. The main goal of this application is to fully recreate the Digimon battle experience into a battle simulator environment for enthusiasts.

At the moment, the teambuilding aspect has been fully completed, allowing players to assemble their own Digimon teams of their choice with [animated sprites][4] and [custom attack techniques][5]. However, in the upcoming v1.1 update, the battle aspect will be introduced. This will open a new possibility for players to engage in battles against each other. This update will be coming soon:tm:
